# Proprietary version
Please do not clone or download this version, since it is specific to our school (EPI on Aruba). You can browse the code, analyse differences with the current repo, or even submit issues (but I prefer it if the issues are on the master branch).

## why it shouldn't be used
1. the text in the UI is in Dutch
2. there are several references to our DB and internal school structure (called units)
